excerpt: 'In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive study for the unconstrained 
 over sparsity promoting model, widely used in the regime of coherent dictionaries for recovering nonnegative sparse signals. First, we prove the existence of global solutions. Second, we analyze the sparse property of any local minimizer of the model. This property serves as a certificate to rule out the nonlocal minimizers. Third, we focus on algorithmic development on the unconstrained model with nonnegative constraint. We derive an analytical solution for the proximal operator of the with nonnegative constraint. Then, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers in a particular splitting way, referred to as ADMM. We establish its global convergence to a d-stationary solution (sharpest stationary) by verifying the Lyapunov function with the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property instead of imposing. Extensive numerical simulations confirm the superiority of ADMM over the existing state-of-the-art methods in nonnegative sparse recovery.'
