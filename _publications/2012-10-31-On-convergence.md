excerpt: 'It was shown recently that the Douglas--Rachford alternating direction method of multipliers can be combined with the logarithmic-quadratic proximal regularization for solving a class of variational inequalities with separable structures. This paper further shows a worst-case O⁢(1/𝑡) convergence rate for this algorithm where a general Glowinski relaxation factor is used.'
